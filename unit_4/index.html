		<h3>The Bucket List</h3>
		<p>Travel has always been on the agenda. They say it takes around 10 days to truly feel the benefits of a holiday. In Australia we have 4 weeks of holiday up our sleeve every year, some companies will also let you take unpaid leave and buy back extra time. Its not uncommon to take a 6 week holiday. I haven't taken a holiday like this in some time but am starting to feel the need to. At Christmas time we have forced office shutdown. Australia is in full blown holiday mode, for around 2 weeks, unless you're working in retail. There are a number of public holidays at that time so we end up using only a few actual accrued holidays.  The plan this year is to camp by the beach for a few days, then come home and veg and go to the beach most days. I can't wait. Its not the holiday of my dreams. Greece is. Greece isn't in the budget just yet though, paying off debt and accruing some savings. Until that time, we live in a beautiful area and I'm determined to feel content and just enjoy what we have.</p>

	<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		<p>Lately I've been thinking about having more hobbies. I've taken social media off my phone and am trying utilise that time in more worthwhile pursuits. I have been thinking about how I used to have to many hobbies as a kid, yet as an adult seem to spend a lot of time working and commuting, getting home and cooking and prepping for the day ahead. Hobbies take our mind and soul to a different place. Currently I'm trying my hand at gardening and am growing these little basil seedlings. They sprouted already and I'm quite pleased! I'm hoping that I can grow a full basil plant from these sprouts. We have a problem with cockatoos in our area. They can be quite distructive birds. I build a netted area to protect my little plants and so far so good. Here is a picture of the basil!
